# Online book club
A simple web-based book club developed for a university course on web development.

# Features description
The site allows users to register. Once registered, a user can add books to his/her private collection, either by choosing them from those in the library or by adding them manually. Books that are part of the user's private collection can be accompanied by a comment and a rating.  
From the library, a user can operate on the books present by adding them to his/her private collection or by suggesting them to other users. A user sees the books that have been suggested to him/her on the right-hand side of the home page, together with the name of the user who suggested them; on these books, the user can:
- View their details, including the rating and comment assigned by the user who suggested them;
- Add such books to his/her private collection;
- Remove such books from the list of suggested books.

The library displays, if no search has been made, the 3 most recently added books. For each book, some summary data is displayed, including a rating calculated from all the ratings assigned to that book by all users. To view all the details of a book, simply click on it.  
Also from the library, a user can search for books according to various characteristics such as title, author, year of publication, etc. Results can then be filtered by genre.

To rate and comment on a book, a user can simply add it to his/her private collection and click on it from the user's home page. Comments and votes assigned to a book remain private except if the user suggests a book to another user, in which case the user to whom the book was suggested will be able to view them.
